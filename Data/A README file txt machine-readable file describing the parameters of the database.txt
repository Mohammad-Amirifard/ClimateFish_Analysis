Abstract: The ClimateFish database collates abundance data of 15 fish 
species proposed as candidate indicators of climate change in the 
Mediterranean Sea. An initial group of 8 Mediterranean indigenous 
species (Epinephelus marginatus, Thalassoma pavo, Sparisoma cretense, 
Coris julis, Sarpa salpa, Serranus scriba, Serranus cabrilla and Caranx 
crysos) with wide distribution, responsiveness to temperature conditions 
and easy identification were selected by a network of Mediterranean 
scientists joined under the CIESM programme â€˜Tropical Signalsâ€™ 
https://www.ciesm.org/marine/programs/tropicalization.htm (Azzurro et 
al. 2011). Soon after, and thanks to the discussion with other expert 
groups and projects, C. crysos was no longer considered, and Lessepsian 
fishes (Red Sea species entering the Mediterranean through the Suez 
Canal)  were included, namely:  Fistularia commersonii, Siganus luridus, 
Siganus rivulatus, Pterois miles, Stephanolopis diaspros, Parupeneus 
forskali, Pempheris rhomboidea and Torquigener flavimaculosus. 
Considering the trends of increase  of these species in the 
Mediterranean Sea (Golani et al. 2021) and their climate affinity 
(Dâ€™Amen, M. and Azzurro, E., 2020), more data on these tropical invaders 
are expected to come in the future implementation of the study. Data 
were collected according to a standard and simplified visual census  
methodology (Garrabou et al. 2019) along standard transects of 5 minutes 
performed at a constant speed of 10m/min,   corresponding approximately 
to an area of 50x5m. Four different depth layers were surveyed:  0-3m, 
5-10 m, 11-20 m, 21-30 m. So far, the ClimateFish database includes fish 
counts collected along  3142 transects carried out in 7 Mediterranean 
countries between 2009 and 2021, for a total number of 101'771 observed 
individuals belonging to the 15 fish species. Data were collected by a 
large team of researchers which joined to a common monitoring strategy 
supported by different international projects, which are  acknowledged 
below. This database, when associated with climate data, offers new 
opportunities to investigate spatio-temporal effects of climate change 
in the Mediterranean Sea and test the effectiveness of each species as a 
possible climate change indicator.

Project/Program: The Mediterranean ClimateFish initiative was initially 
conceived by the international basin wide monitoring program CIESM 
Tropical Signals (funded by the Albert II of Monaco Foundation) and 
subsequently supported by the Interreg Med Programme (Projects: MPA 
Adapt, grant number  1MED15_3.2_M2_337 and MPA Engage, grant number 
MED18_3.2_M23_007), 85% co funded by the European Regional Development 
Fund.The Interreg Med project MPA Engage (grant number: 5216 | 
5MED18_3.2_M23_007) partially supported this work.


Processing methodology: first of all, training sessions/materials were 
delivered to both MPA staff and collaborating researchers; data were 
collected by trained people according to the same protocol and checked 
by the same people before submission; formatted data were then examined 
for error and underwent the technical validation process; data were 
gathered and formatted to meet Darwin Core archive standards where 
reports which did not meet inclusion criteria were removed; the data 
were manually examined again for quality assessment and to detect any 
remaining error.
